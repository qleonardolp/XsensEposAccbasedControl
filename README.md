# Acceleration-based Transparency Control application on an Exoskeleton Knee Joint

This project consist of the development of an application on MS Visual Studio (C/C++) that binds togheter the control of a maxon motor, with EPOS, using IMUs data, in this case Xsens MTw sensors.
With this hardware, using the EPOS command libraries and Xsens SDK herein is applied the acceleration-based transparency control [[1]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7759836) on a 
wearable robot: the lower limbs exoskeleton designed by the Robotic Rehabilitation Laboratory (SÃ£o Carlos School of Engineering).

## Setting up the Visual Studio solution

This solution has been developed under VS Express 2012, but feel free to try under another version. Follow the steps below to configure the VS solution before run the project:

- Add the 'Win32/include' directory path of this repository to "Additional Include Directories", under Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General;
- Repeat the previous step for the path where [Eigen 3.3.7](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/GettingStarted.html) was extracted;
- Add the 'Win32/lib' directory path of this repository to "Additional Library Directories", under Configuration Properties > Linker > General;
- Repeat the previous step adding '$(NIEXTCCOMPILERSUPP)\lib32\msvc' to "Additional Library Directories";
- Copy the '.lib' files on 'Win32/lib' to the Debug folder, or wherever the executable is after build the solution in VS. It is necessary to run the program.
